## Windy City Tours Application

This application is my final group capstone project, as a Java development bootcamp student. It is the culmination of the three-module learning program, utilizing Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, NPM, Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Our team worked in an agile environment and built our shared code-base through Git.

This application enables users to view a curated list of landmarks in Chicago, IL, USA, and build an itinerary with route options.

### Key Features

* The home page displays a curated list of must-see Chicago landmarks.
* Landmarks can be filtered by name search, category type, or days open.

* Upon registering for an account, authenticated users can create their own itineraries and add landmarks.
* Registered users can make their itineraries public, inspiring fellow users in building their own itineraries.
* Registered users can edit the starting point of their itinerary, which provides them the best itinerary route.
