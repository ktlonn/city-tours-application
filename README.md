## Windy City Tours Application

This application is the final group capstone project, which was created during my time as a Java development bootcamp student. It is the culmination of the three-module learning program, utilizing Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Google API services. Our team worked in an agile environment and built our shared code-base through Git.

This application enables users to view a curated list of landmarks in Chicago, IL, USA, and build an itinerary with route options.
